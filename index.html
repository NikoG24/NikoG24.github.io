            <p>I am a dedicated sophomore student at Boise State University, actively pursuing academic and personal
                growth. My
                skills include strong listening abilities, a tireless work ethic, and an eagerness to learn and adapt to

                <h2>Lock Wizard</h2>
                <p>
                    I developed a VR training module in Unity, guiding users through tasks within a lifelike virtual
                    environment. I collaborated closely with a team of four to ensure an impactful VR experience, taking
                    the lead on game element design. Utilizing a 360 camera, we enhanced our virtual reality environment
                    in Unity, focusing on creating immersive experiences. Specifically, I designed interactive elements
                    such as locks and lock-picking tools, including rakes and hooks.

                <h2>Data Visualization Website</h2>
                <p>Designed and implemented interactive data dashboards using HTML and JavaScript to monitor performance
                    metrics and analyze trends in NFL quarterback performance. The dashboards compared quarterbacks from
                    both teams in each Super Bowl, allowing users to see how their seasons aligned and to compare them
                    with quarterbacks from past Super Bowls. I translated complex statistical data into intuitive,
                    user-friendly visualizations for easy comparison and analysis.</p>

                <h2>Superposition</h2>
                <p>For this project, we were given an abstract concept and tasked with transforming it into a storyboard
                    book. My group's concept focused on superposition, which we illustrated through a creative superhero
                    narrative. In our story, the superhero uses the principles of superposition to battle a powerful
                    crime boss. As part of the project, we also developed a mini-game incorporating the concept of
                    superposition. I contributed to both the narrative and the design, creating specific elements
                    showcased in the art tab under storyboard section.

                <h2>Goblin Teasure Run</h2>
                <p>This was my first experience developing a game. I started with a platformer game stub provided in
                    class and built upon it with my own designs. I created the characters, background art, and several
                    C# scripting elements. One of the key features I implemented was enemy behavior-specifically, coding
                    enemies to detect and shoot at the player as they move through the environment. The shooting
                    mechanic included player tracking to make the gameplay more challenging and engaging.In the art
                    section of my portfolio I have some of the art
                    I used in this project and also have a trailer I made to show case the game below.
