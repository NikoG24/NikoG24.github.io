            <p>I am a dedicated sophomore student at Boise State University, actively pursuing academic and personal
                growth. My
                skills include strong listening abilities, a tireless work ethic, and an eagerness to learn and adapt to
                new
                challenges. I thrive in environments where I can explore topics that spark my interest, demonstrating a

                <h2>Lock Wizard</h2>
                <p>
                    Developed a VR training experience using Unity, walking users through a task in a realistic virtual
                    environment. Collaborated closely with a team of 4 to drive an effective VR experience. Lead and
                    executed the game elements design. .We used a 360 camera to make our virtual reality environment
                    then add to it through unity to make it more immersive for the user.The game desgin element that I
                    created to user for our unity envirnment are
                    the lock, and lock picking tools like a rack and hook.

                <h2>Data Visualization Website</h2>
                <p>Designed and implemented interactive data dashboards using HTML and JavaScript to monitor
                    performance metrics and identify trends in NFL Quarterback performance.These quaterback were tracked
                    based on their season performance of how they made it to the superbowl.I showed both quaterbacks on
                    both teams that made it to the superbowl so you can see how their season matched up together and
                    compare them to other quaterback from different superbowls.I translated these stats into a
                    user-friendly dashboards.</p>

                <h2>Superposition</h2>
                <p>For the project we where given a abstract concept to make into a story board book.My groups concept
                    was based on superposition so to show how superposition works we made it into a superhero that goes
                    around fighting this crime boss.You where also tasked with making a mini game that also involved our
                    concept of superposition.Here are some images on what the project looks like and the element I
                    designed.

                <h2>Goblin Teasure Run</h2>
                <p>This was my first ever time making a game.I used the stub giving to me in class of a platformer game
                    to make my design.The things I made for the game was the characters,background and c# elements.
                    For example I made the coding elements for the enemies to shoot at the player as he tries to get to
                    the end.The shooitng element is focused on tracking the player as he move through the
                    environment.Here is the code for that and also some images on what the game looks like.
